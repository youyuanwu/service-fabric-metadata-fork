# Generating Service Fabric metadata with Rust

`rust-metadata` is the repository's supported generator for
`.windows/winmd/Windows.ServiceFabric.winmd`. It uses the published
windows-rs metadata crates and does not require a separate managed SDK or
package restore.

Service Fabric types are emitted under `Windows.ServiceFabric.*`. Sharing the
`Windows` top-level root with `Windows.Win32.*` lets metadata reference
`Windows.Win32.FILETIME` directly without defining a Service Fabric-local copy.

## Pipeline

1. `run.ps1` discovers Visual Studio and the Windows SDK, then enters an x64
   developer environment.
2. `windows-clang` provisions its pinned libclang release.
3. The Windows SDK `midl.exe` compiles the Service Fabric IDL files into
   headers.
4. `windows-clang` uses its SDK-style per-header mode to scrape five flat RDL
   partitions in dependency order.
5. `windows-rdl` compiles the flat partitions, then `windows-metadata`
   structurally remaps each header's owned items into
   `Windows.ServiceFabric.<Partition>`.
6. The remapped metadata is round-tripped through RDL and recompiled with
   `Windows.Win32.winmd` as a reference. This preserves external assembly
   resolution scopes that `windows-metadata` 0.100's remapper does not carry
   into its output.
7. The generator verifies typed semantic equality across that scope-repair
   roundtrip and writes the single `Windows.ServiceFabric.winmd`.

Intermediate headers, RDL, partition metadata, and the embedded flat Win32
reference remain under `rust-metadata/target/gen`. Only the final Service
Fabric metadata file is committed.

## Required transformations

Per-header scraping applies the same structural canonicalization used to build
the base windows-rs Win32 metadata:

- Canonicalizes `LPCWSTR` references to `Windows.Win32.PCWSTR` and suppresses
  the redundant local alias.
- Preserves `FABRIC_STRING_PAIR` automatically as a secondary record alias of
  `FABRIC_APPLICATION_PARAMETER`.
- Emits `FABRIC_URI` as its source-defined transparent alias of `PCWSTR`,
  rather than manufacturing a distinct handle-like newtype.
- Preserves source IDL spellings, including
  `FABRIC_AAD_ClAIMS_RETRIEVAL_METADATA`, rather than applying name-specific
  corrections after scraping.
- Keeps `FILETIME` as `Windows.Win32.FILETIME`; Service Fabric metadata also
  uses the `Windows` root, so the final metadata remains single-rooted without
  a local duplicate definition.

The generator performs only the Service Fabric-specific metadata additions
after scraping:

- Marks C-style enums as scoped so binding generation preserves their newtype
  representation.
- Marks interfaces whose names match `IFabric\w+` with
  `MarshalingBehaviorAttribute(Agile)` so binding generation retains the
  expected thread-agility behavior. Non-matching interfaces are not marked.

The agility marker definitions are in `rust-metadata/seed/FabricAgile.rdl`.

## Generate

Prerequisites are a stable Rust toolchain, Visual Studio C++ build tools, a
Windows 10 or 11 SDK containing x64 `midl.exe`, PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`), and
CMake. The first run may download the pinned libclang component.

Use the standard CMake target:

```pwsh
cmake . -B build -T host=x64 -A x64
cmake --build build --target generate_winmd
```

Or run the generator directly:

```pwsh
pwsh -File rust-metadata/run.ps1
```

Both commands write `.windows/winmd/Windows.ServiceFabric.winmd`.

## Validate

```pwsh
cmake --build build --target validate_winmd
```

Validation uses `windows-metadata` to compare the regenerated artifact with the
committed Rust-generated baseline. It compares type sets, type flags,
inheritance, implemented interfaces, class layout, fields, constants, method
signatures and parameter metadata, GUIDs, and custom attributes. This avoids a
dependency on `ildasm` and ignores container details that are not part of the
typed metadata model.

The initial Rust migration was checked once against the retired baseline: the
previous artifact contained 1,263 types and the Windows-rooted Rust artifact
contains 1,278 types. All 272 real `IFabric*` interfaces retained their short
names, GUIDs, and ordered method names. Three duplicate mangled artifacts that
did not represent distinct APIs were intentionally omitted:

- `IFabricClientConnectionEventHandler0000`
- `IFabricClientConnectionEventHandler0001`
- `IFabricServiceNotificationEventHandler0000`

## Troubleshooting

- **Visual Studio discovery fails**: install Visual Studio C++ build tools, or
  set `SF_METADATA_VSWHERE` / `SF_METADATA_VS_INSTALL_PATH`.
- **`midl.exe` is missing**: install a Windows 10 or 11 SDK, or set
  `SF_METADATA_WINDOWS_KITS_BIN`.
- **libclang provisioning fails**: verify network access on the first run; the
  provisioned component is cached for later runs.
- **Validation reports differences**: regenerate intentionally, inspect the
  typed difference report, and commit the updated winmd only when the metadata
  change is expected.
